- links
- images

#### Extended syntax
- Fenced code blocks (no syntax highligthing)

- definition lists
- task lists
- highligth
- subscript and superscript

### Feature implementation
I include features in the same order [this website](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) list them.

This project is a side project so I will not give it much attention, it may even remain unfinished.
